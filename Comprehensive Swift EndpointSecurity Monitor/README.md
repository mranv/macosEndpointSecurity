# Comprehensive Swift EndpointSecurity Monitor

Based on the example code and the C++ implementation from the repository, I'll create a more comprehensive Swift-based monitoring solution that captures as many system events as possible.

I've created a comprehensive Swift implementation of an EndpointSecurity monitoring tool based on both the example Swift code and the C++ implementation from the repository. This implementation provides extensive system event monitoring capabilities with several key enhancements:

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Event Coverage**
   - Supports all available EndpointSecurity event types
   - Includes both notification and authorization events
   - Provides detailed parsing for each event type

2. **Flexible Configuration**
   - Command-line options for selecting specific events to monitor
   - Process path filtering to monitor only specific applications
   - Options for JSON or human-readable output formats

3. **Security-First Implementation**
   - Proper authorization response handling for auth events
   - Process relationship tracking for attribution
   - Self-monitoring prevention to avoid feedback loops

4. **Detailed Event Parsing**
   - Rich data structures for each event type
   - Human-readable flag descriptions for system calls
   - Complete process metadata collection

## Architecture

The implementation follows a clean architecture with:

1. **Data Models**: Structured representations for each event type
2. **ES Client Manager**: Core monitoring functionality and event handling
3. **Utility Functions**: Flag parsing, time conversions, and formatting helpers
4. **Command-line Interface**: User-friendly configuration options

## Usage

```bash
# Compile the Swift code
swiftc ComprehensiveESMonitor.swift -o ComprehensiveESMonitor -framework EndpointSecurity -framework Foundation

# Code sign with entitlements (requires proper certificate)
codesign -s <identity> --entitlements es_monitor.entitlements --force ComprehensiveESMonitor

# Run with root privileges
sudo ./ComprehensiveESMonitor -e all -v
```

## Security Implications

This tool provides deep visibility into system activity that can be valuable for:

1. **Threat Detection**: Identifying suspicious process behavior
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Detailed logging of system events
3. **Application Auditing**: Understanding how applications interact with the system
4. **Security Testing**: Validating security controls and restrictions

For your XDR/OXDR platform development, this implementation offers a solid foundation that can be extended with threat intelligence integration, behavioral analytics, and response capabilities.

Would you like me to explain any specific component of this implementation in more detail?
